# TwitterEqualizer
https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1YgsnDbAeVKezhCyrqlaGKBBGgSbeUlQJ?usp=sharing

This project was initially created by myself. The purpose was the enable me to equalize my timelines on the two twitter accounts I have, making the experience mostly similar. 

It uses the twitter api and tweepy mostly and requires that you have a twitter api app with requsite permissions ready to go. 

You can find the code and run it with all the comments on the Google Colab linked above.

In the future we can expect more features to be added including but not limited to:

  1. Transferring all the retweets by one user to the other.
  2. Other analytics to make sure that your timeline experience is consistent across apps.
